				<blockquote>"A DIV is a block level container that you can use to group sections of block level content together. You should only use these elements when there isn't a more appropriate, semantic element to use for marking up content. Marking up paragraphs and headings all with DIVs is a terrible thing to do, as although it might look ok, the page will be inaccessible to those using screen readers"
